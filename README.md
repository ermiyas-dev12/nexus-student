* Local SQLite database (not scalable for production use)

---

## Future Improvements

* Integration with OpenAI API for advanced chatbot responses
* User authentication and profile system
* Deployment on cloud (AWS / Render / Railway)
* PostgreSQL database for scalability

---

## Purpose

* Full-stack web development
* Backend API design
* Frontend UI/UX implementation
* Practical problem-solving for real-world users
